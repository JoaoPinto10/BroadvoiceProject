To clarify the requirements, I would ask the following questions:
	Is there a specific format or validation requirements for the email address?
	Is there a specific format or length requirement for the temporary password?
	After the user receives the temporary password via email, is there a timeline in which they must change it?
	Should there be any validation or error messages if the user tries to create an account with invalid input data (for example: invalid email format)?
	Should there be any validation or error messages if the user tries to create an account with an email address that already exists in the database?

These are some possible test cases based on the provided information:

Test Case 1: Valid User Creation
Description: Email should be valid (ex, "example@email.com"), valid first name (ex, "John") and valid last name (ex, "Doe"). Click save button. 
Expected Result: User is created successfully, and the user receives an email with a temporary password they must change shortly. The user data is saved in the database.

Test Case 2: Invalid Email Format
Description: Invalid email notification (ex, "emailnotvalid").  Valid first name and last name and clicking save button.
Expected Result: An Error message is displayed indicating that the email format is invalid. User is not created and the data is not saved in the database.

Test Case 3: Invalid First Name Length
Description: Valid email, invalid first name with fewer than 6 characters (ex, "John"), valid last name, and clicking save button.
Expected Result: An Error message is displayed indicating that the first name must be between 6 and 30 characters. User is not created, and the information is not saved in the database.

Test Case 4: Invalid Last Name Length
Description: Valid email, valid first name, invalid last name with fewer than 6 characters (ex, "Doe‚Äù), and clicking save button.
Expected Result: An Error message is displayed indicating that the last name must be between 6 and 30 characters. User is not created, and the information is not saved in the database.

Test Case 5: Email already exists
Description: Email that already exists in the database, valid first name, valid last name, clicking save button.
Expected Result: An error message is displayed indicating that the email already exists. The user is not created, and no information is saved in the database.

Test Case 6: User Creation Time Limit
Description: Valid email, valid first name, valid last name, and click Save button.
Expected Result: User is successfully created within 3 seconds. If the creation takes longer, an error message is displayed indicating that user creation took too long. No data is saved in the database.
